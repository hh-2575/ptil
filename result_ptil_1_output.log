=== Compute subgraph group sizes (random even partition of all nodes) ===
Total nodes: 6000
Number of groups: 1

Grouping result (random even split):
  Group 0: 6000 nodes

Verify:
  Total assigned nodes: 6000
  Expected nodes: 6000
  Min group size: 6000
  Max group size: 6000
  Size gap: 0 (should be <= 1)
  Average group size: 6000.00
  Std dev: 0.00 (smaller is more even)
